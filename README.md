This is a simple yet sleek **CSS mini project** I built as part of my web development learning journey.  
It's inspired by the clean sidebar navigation you often see in real-world apps — and yep, I themed it around **Netflix** for that cool factor.

 🔥 What It Does

- Hamburger menu (☰) that opens a smooth sliding sidebar
- Font Awesome icons for a modern UI look
- Hover effects to make the interface feel more alive
- Responsive layout using just **HTML + CSS**
- No JavaScript involved (yet) — pure CSS magic!

 🧠 What I Learned

- How to create an interactive layout using the **checkbox hack**
- Mastered `position: fixed`, `vh`, and sibling combinators like `~`
- Built confidence using Google Fonts, Font Awesome, and visual hierarchy
- Understood transitions and hover animations that make UIs engaging
